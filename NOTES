Java :- 
        
        It is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
        It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
        It is used for:
            Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
            Desktop applications
            Web applications
            Web servers and application servers
            Games
            Database connection
            And much, much more!

Comments in Java :-

        .Single line comments :- 
                Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
                Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java.

        . Multiline Comments:- 
                Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
                Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.

Java Variables:-

        Variables are containers for storing data values.
        In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:
            String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
            int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
            float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
            char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
            boolean - stores values with two states: true or false


JVM, JRE, JDK :-
        (Java Virtual Machine - Specification)
        (Java Runtime Environment - It is the implementation of JVM)
        (Java Development Kit - Kit that contaion Development tools, JRE)


OPERATORS :- 

        Ranks:- 
                1. Brackets
                2. Divide / Multiply :- system run according to the position of it in the code.
                3. Addition / Subtraction :- system run according to the position of it in the code.


TAKING INPUT AND OUTPUT
        OUTPUT :- 
                System.out.println("Hello World");
                System.out.println(3+3);
                System.out.println(15*6);
        INPUT :-
                Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
                int n=scn.nextInt();
                e.g.
                import java.util.Scanner;
                class studnet {
                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
                        int n=scn.nextInt();
                        System.out.println("hii"+n);    
                }
        }
