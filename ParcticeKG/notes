OOPS IN JAVA

1. PROCESS VS OBJECT ORIENTED
    - Process is a collection of instructions executed by the computer, while an object is an instance of a class in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 
    

2. INSTANCE VARIABLE AND METHODS
    -Instance variables in Java are non-static variables which are defined in a class outside any method, constructor or a block.

    -Instance methods are methods that are declared within a class but outside any other method or block

    -class properties called instance variable and method is called as instance method 

/*
    example:- 
    class Person {
    // Instance variable
    String name;

    // Instance method
    void printName() {
        System.out.println(name);
    }
    }

    // Create an object of the Person class
    Person p = new Person();

    // Set the name of the object
    p.name = "John Doe";

    // Call the printName() method
    p.printName();

3. DECLARING OBJECTS
    
    -Object Creation:= new instantiates a new object of a class.
    -Memory Allocation:= Allocates memory for the object in the heap.
    -Constructor Invocation:= Calls the class constructor to initialize the object.
    -Reference Return:= Returns a reference to the created object.
    -Array Creation:= Also used for creating arrays, like int[] arr = new int[5];.
    -Dynamic Allocation:= Unlike static allocation, new allows for dynamic memory allocation ,allocating memory at runtime

        (Declaration) (Instantiation)  (Initialization)

        here student1 is reference variable of Student Type
        new is Java Keyword to instantiation of a class
