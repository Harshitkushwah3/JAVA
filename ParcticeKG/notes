OOPS IN JAVA

1. PROCESS VS OBJECT ORIENTED
    - Process is a collection of instructions executed by the computer, while an object is an instance of a class in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 
    

2. INSTANCE VARIABLE AND METHODS
    -Instance variables in Java are non-static variables which are defined in a class outside any method, constructor or a block.

    -Instance methods are methods that are declared within a class but outside any other method or block

    -class properties called instance variable and method is called as instance method 

/*
    example:- 
    class Person {
    // Instance variable
    String name;

    // Instance method
    void printName() {
        System.out.println(name);
    }
    }

    // Create an object of the Person class
    Person p = new Person();

    // Set the name of the object
    p.name = "John Doe";

    // Call the printName() method
    p.printName();

*/

3. DECLARING OBJECTS
    
    -Object Creation:= new instantiates a new object of a class.
    -Memory Allocation:= Allocates memory for the object in the heap.
    -Constructor Invocation:= Calls the class constructor to initialize the object.
    -Reference Return:= Returns a reference to the created object.
    -Array Creation:= Also used for creating arrays, like int[] arr = new int[5];.
    -Dynamic Allocation:= Unlike static allocation, new allows for dynamic memory allocation ,allocating memory at runtime

    SYNTAX => 
        Student student1 = new Student() 
        |        |          |       |
        |        |          |       |
        ^        ^          ^       ^
       (Class   (Object    (Key    (Constructor)
        Name)    Name      word)
                   or
                Reference)
       |                  | |   | |           |
       |__________________| |___| |___________|          
                |             |          |
                ^             ^          ^
        (Declaration) (Instantiation)  (Initialization)
 
        here student1 is reference variable of Student Type
        new is Java Keyword to instantiation of a class 


4. CLASS VS OBJECT

    -In Java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties    and behaviors of objects. An object is an instance of a class that has actual values for those properties.
    
    -Classes are used to create objects, which are instances of that class. For example, you might have a class called "Car" that defines the properties and behaviors of cars. You could then create objects of the "Car" class to represent specific cars.



5. THIS KEYWORD

    -this refers to the current object in a method or constructor. It is used to access the instance variables and methods of the current object. It is also used to pass the current object as an argument to another method.

6.  STATIC KEYWORD
    
    -The static keyword in Java is used to declare a class member that is shared by all instances of the class. Static members are also called class members. Static members can be variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes.

    - It belong to the class not individual instances and can be called without creating an object.

    --Here are some of the key points to remember about the static keyword in Java:
        Static variables are shared by all instances of the class.
        Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.
        Static blocks are executed when the class is loaded into memory.
        Nested classes can be static or non-static.


7. CONSTRUCTOR
    
    -A constructor in Java is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
    
    -Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to and they do not have a return type. Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.

    example
    
    import java.io.*;
 
    // Driver Class
    class Geeks {
       
        // Constructor
        Geeks()
        {
            super();
            System.out.println("Constructor Called");
        }
     
        // main function
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            Geeks geek = new Geeks();
        }
    }

    - Type of it

        => Default Constructor: If no constructor is
        explicitly defined, Java provides a
        default constructor that initializes all
        member variables to default values.

        => Parameterized Constructors:
        Constructors can have parameters to
        pass values when creating an object,
        allowing for different initializations. 

        car(String color){ // here we define that the color defining is mandotory for accessing the  car object
            this.color=color;
            no_of_seats = 4 ;

        }

    => Constructor Chaining
        we can define more than 1 constructor of same class and call one constructor from another using "this()" keyword
        

8. CODE BLOCK

    1. Scope: Code blocks {} determine the scope of variables.  
    2. Local Variables: Variables inside a block are not accessible 
    outside it.
    3. Initialization Block: Blocks without static run each time an 
    instance is created.
    4. Static Block: Blocks with static run once when the class is 
    loaded.

9. HEAP MEMORY AND STACK MEMORY

    -The major difference between Stack memory and heap memory is that the stack is used to store the order of method execution and local variables while the heap memory stores the objects and it uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

9. VARIABLE SCOPE

    -the variable scope in java is divided into two parts-
     1) local variable (declared within methods or constructors)
     2) non-local variable (declared outside methods or constructors).

10. GARBAGE COLLECTION AND FINALIZE
/*
    1=> Automatic Process: Garbage collection is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), running in the background.
    
    2=> Object Eligibility: Objects that are no longer reachable, meaning no active references to them, are eligible for garbage collection.
    
    3=> No Manual Control: Unlike languages like C++, Java developers cannot explicitly deallocate memory. Garbage collection is automatic and non-deterministic.
    
    4=> Generational Collection: Java uses a generational garbage collection strategy, which divides memory into different regions (young, old, and permanent generations) based on object ages.
    
    5=> Heap Memory: Garbage collection occurs in the heap memory, where all Java objects reside.
    
    6=> Performance Impact: Garbage collection can affect application performance, particularly if it runs frequently or takes a long time to complete.
*/
/*
    1=> Finalization: Before an object is garbage collected, the finalize() method may be called, giving the object a chance to clean up resources. However, it's not guaranteed to run, and its usage is generally discouraged.

    2=> Optimization: Developers can optimize the process indirectly through code practices, like setting unnecessary object references to null.
    
    3=> System.gc() Call: While System.gc() suggests that the JVM performs garbage collection, it's not a guarantee.
*/

11.  PRIMITIVE VS REFERENCE TYPE

    PRIMITIVE STORED IN STACK WHILE NON-PRIMITE STROE IN HEAP (REFERENCE) MEMORY

                  A=> NUMERIC==> 1. INTEGER   2. FLOATING POINT
    PRIMITIVE ==>|
                  B=> NON-NUMERIC==> 1. CHARACTER 2. BOOLEAN

    
    NON-PRIMITIVE==> 1. CLASS
                     2. ARRAY
                     3. INTERFACE
                     4. OBJECT
                     5. STRING


  = Primitive store actual value while reference store address of that value.
  = Primitive store values in stack but reference type store in the heap.
  = Primitive have specific values like 0 or false ; reference type default to null.
  = Primitive compared by values ; reference types compared by reference.
  = Access to primitive is faster.

12. CONTROL STATEMENTS, MATHS & STRINGS

    Ternary operator :
        Syntax => condition ? expression1 : expression2
        Condition => Boolean expression, evaluates to true or false.
        Expressions => Both expressions must return compatible types.
        Use Case => Suitable for simple conditional assignments.
        Readability => Good for simple conditions, but can reduce clarity if overused.

    Switch :

        Multiple Cases => Handles multiple values for an expression efficiently.
        Supported Types => Accepts byte, short, char, int, String, enums, and from Java 14, long, float, double.
        Case Labels => Each case ends with a colon (:) and is followed by code.
        Break Statement => Typically used to prevent fall-through between cases.
        Default Case => Executes if no case matches; optional and doesn't require break.
        Type Safety => Case label types must match the switch expression's type. 

        
13. LOOPS(Do while)

        syntax: do{   
                    //code to be executed  
                }while(condition);

        1. Executes block first, then checks condition.
        2. Guaranteed to run at least one iteration.
        3. Unlike while, first iteration is unconditional.
        4. Don't forget to update condition to avoid infinite loops.
           
        
14. LOOPS (For) 
                
    1. Standard loop for running code multiple times.
    2. Generally preferred for counting iterations.


15. FOR EACH

    1. A method for array iteration, often preferred for readability.
    2. Parameters: One for item, optional second for index.
    3. Using return is similar to continue in traditional loops.
    4. Not straightforward to break out of a forEach loop.
    5. When you need to perform an action on each array element and don't need to break early
                    
        
16. RECURSION
    
    1. Self-Calling Function: Recursion is when a function calls itself.
    2. Base Case: Essential to stop recursion and prevent infinite loops.
    3. Recursive Case: The part where the function makes a recursive call.
    4. Stack Overflow Risk: Excessive recursion can cause stack overflow errors.
    5. Problem Solving: Ideal for problems divisible into similar, smaller problems.


17. RANDOM NUMBER AND MATH CLASS
               
    1. Static Class: Math methods are static and accessed directly.
    2. Constants: Includes PI and E for π and the base of natural logarithms.

    Key Methods:

    1.  abs(): Absolute value.
    2.  ceil(): Rounds up.
    3.  floor(): Rounds down.
    4.  round(): Rounds to nearest integer.
    5.  max(), min(): Maximum and minimum of two numbers.
    6.  pow(): Power calculation.
    7.  sqrt(): Square root.
    8.  random(): Random number generation.
    9.  exp(), log(): Exponential and logarithmic functions.
    10. Trigonometric functions: sin(), cos(), tan().


18. toString() METHOD

    1. Function: toString() provides a string representation of an object.
    2. Inheritance: It's inherited from the Object class.
    3. Default Format: By default, returns class name, "@", and hashcode.
    4. Overriding: Commonly overridden in custom classes for meaningful output.
    5. Implicit Call: Automatically called in string concatenation.


19. SRING CLASS

    1. Immutability: Once created, a String object's value cannot be changed. Modifications create new String objects.
    2. String Pool: Java maintains a pool of strings for efficiency. When a new string is created, it's checked against the pool for a match to reuse.
    3. Comparing: equals() method for value comparison, == operator checks reference equality.


    1. Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator, but each concatenation creates a new String.
    2. Methods: Provides methods like length(), substring(), equals(), compareTo(), indexOf(), for various operations.
    3. Memory: Being immutable, strings can use more memory when frequently modified.
